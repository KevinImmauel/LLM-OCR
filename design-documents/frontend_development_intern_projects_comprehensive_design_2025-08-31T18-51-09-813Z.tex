\section{System Architecture and Design}

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

Project Phoenix will adopt a microservices architecture, deploying each service independently. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability compared to a monolithic architecture.  Each microservice will be responsible for a specific business function, such as user authentication, product catalog management, or order processing.  This modular approach enables independent scaling of individual services based on demand, improving resource utilization and overall platform performance.  The services will communicate with each other through a lightweight message broker (RabbitMQ) and a well-defined API gateway.  This architecture allows for technology diversity, allowing us to choose the best tools for each service.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Component Interaction and Communication}

The API Gateway acts as the single entry point for all client requests.  It routes requests to the appropriate microservices based on the request path and method.  Services communicate with each other asynchronously using RabbitMQ, a message broker, ensuring loose coupling and improved resilience.  The Authentication Service verifies user credentials and issues JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for subsequent requests. The Product Catalog Service manages product information,  while the Order Management Service handles order placement, processing, and tracking. The External Payment Gateway is responsible for processing payments securely.  All services use RESTful APIs for communication, utilizing standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  Error handling is implemented consistently across all services, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.  Data consistency is maintained through eventual consistency mechanisms leveraging the message broker.

\section{Database Design and Data Architecture}

\subsection{Conceptual Data Model}

The database design employs a relational model for structured data (users, orders) and a NoSQL document database for semi-structured data (products).  This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds, allowing for efficient querying of structured data while maintaining flexibility for handling rich product information.  The relational database (PostgreSQL) will store user information, order details, and transactional data.  The NoSQL database (MongoDB) will store product catalogs, including images, descriptions, and other rich media.  Relationships between databases are managed through unique identifiers and foreign keys where appropriate.  Data integrity is maintained through database constraints and validation rules.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Database ER Diagram}
\label{fig:database-erd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Physical Database Design}

**(PostgreSQL - User and Order Tables)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    shipping_address TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    product_id INTEGER, -- Assuming product_id is from MongoDB
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

**(MongoDB - Product Collection)**  Schema will be flexible to accommodate various product attributes.

```json
{
  "product_id": 123,
  "name": "Example Product",
  "description": "A detailed description of the product...",
  "price": 99.99,
  "image_urls": ["url1.jpg", "url2.jpg"],
  "vendor_id": 456,
  "category": "Electronics",
  "specifications": {
    "size": "10x10",
    "weight": "1kg"
  }
}
```

\section{API Design and Integration}

\subsection{RESTful API Specification}

The APIs will follow RESTful principles, utilizing standard HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange.  Authentication will be handled via JWTs.

**Example Endpoint:**  `/products/{product_id}`

* **GET:** Retrieve product details.  Returns a JSON representation of the product.
* **PUT:** Update product details (requires vendor authentication).
* **DELETE:** Delete a product (requires vendor authentication).

**Example Response (GET /products/123):**

```json
{
  "product_id": 123,
  "name": "Example Product",
  "description": "A detailed description...",
  "price": 99.99,
  "image_urls": ["url1.jpg", "url2.jpg"],
  "vendor_id": 456
}
```

\end{figure}

\subsection{API Security and Rate Limiting}

API security will be implemented using JWTs for authentication and authorization.  Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.  Input validation and sanitization will be performed on all API requests to prevent injection attacks.  HTTPS will be used for all communication to protect data in transit.  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.

\section{Security Architecture and Implementation}

\subsection{Security Requirements and Threat Model}

The security architecture will follow a layered approach, incorporating multiple security controls to protect against various threats.  A detailed threat model will be created, identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.  Key security requirements include:

* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Secure user authentication using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where appropriate.  Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities.
* **Data Protection:** Data encryption at rest and in transit will be implemented to protect sensitive data.  Regular data backups will be performed to ensure data recovery in case of failure.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strict input validation will be performed on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Network Security:**  A firewall will be used to protect the platform's network infrastructure.  Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) will be deployed to monitor and respond to security threats.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.
