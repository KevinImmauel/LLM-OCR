\section{System Architecture and Design}

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

Project Phoenix will utilize a microservices architecture deployed on a cloud platform (AWS).  This approach allows for independent scaling of individual services, improved fault isolation, and faster development cycles.  The system will be composed of several microservices, each responsible for a specific business function.  These services will communicate with each other via a lightweight API gateway.  A message queue (RabbitMQ) will handle asynchronous communication between services.  Data persistence will be managed by a distributed database (PostgreSQL) and a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for caching and session management.

\draw[arrow] (order) -- (payment);
\draw[arrow] (order) -- (user);

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{System Architecture Overview}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Component Interaction and Communication}

The API Gateway acts as the single entry point for all client requests.  It routes requests to the appropriate microservices based on the request path and performs tasks such as authentication and authorization.  Microservices communicate with each other using RESTful APIs over HTTPS.  Asynchronous communication is handled via RabbitMQ, allowing for decoupling and improved performance.  For example, when an order is placed, the Order Service publishes a message to RabbitMQ, which is then consumed by other services such as the Inventory Service and the Payment Service.  This ensures that the order placement process is not blocked by long-running operations.

\section{Database Design and Data Architecture}

\subsection{Conceptual Data Model}

The database design employs a relational model using PostgreSQL for transactional consistency. The core entities include Users, Products, Orders, and OrderItems.  Relationships are defined using foreign keys to ensure data integrity.  The schema is designed for optimal performance and scalability, considering indexing strategies and query optimization techniques.  Normalization principles are applied to minimize data redundancy and improve data consistency.

\begin{figure}[H]

\node[entity, below=of user] (product) {\textbf{Products} \\ \hrule \underline{product\_id (PK)} \\ name \\ description \\ price \\ inventory\_level \\ seller\_id};

\draw[one] (user.east) -- node[above, midway] {places} ++(1.25,0) coordinate (t1);
\draw[many] (t1) -- (order.west);
\draw[one] (order.south) -- ++(0,-1.25) coordinate (t2);
\draw[many] (t2) -- (order_item.north);
\draw[one] (product.east) -- ++(1.25,0) coordinate (t3);
\draw[many] (t3) -- (order_item.west);

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Database ER Diagram}
\label{fig:database-erd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Physical Database Design}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Users Table:}  user\_id (INT, PK), username (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE), email (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE), password\_hash (VARCHAR(255)), address (TEXT), phone (VARCHAR(20))
    \item \textbf{Products Table:} product\_id (INT, PK), name (VARCHAR(255)), description (TEXT), price (DECIMAL(10,2)), inventory\_level (INT), seller\_id (INT, FK)
    \item \textbf{Orders Table:} order\_id (INT, PK), user\_id (INT, FK), order\_date (TIMESTAMP), total\_amount (DECIMAL(10,2)), shipping\_address (TEXT)
    \item \textbf{OrderItems Table:} item\_id (INT, PK), order\_id (INT, FK), product\_id (INT, FK), quantity (INT), price (DECIMAL(10,2))
\end{itemize}
Indexes will be created on foreign keys and frequently queried columns to optimize query performance.  Constraints will be implemented to ensure data integrity, such as unique constraints on usernames and emails.

\section{API Design and Integration}

\subsection{RESTful API Specification}

The platform will expose a RESTful API for interaction with various clients (web, mobile).  The API will follow standard REST principles, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.  Authentication will be implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse.

\textbf{Example Endpoint:}  `/products/{product_id}`

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GET:} Retrieves details for a specific product.  Response: JSON object containing product details.
    \item \textbf{PUT:} Updates the details of a specific product (for sellers only).  Request: JSON object containing updated product details.  Response:  HTTP 200 OK on success, appropriate error codes on failure.
\end{itemize}

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{API Request Sequence Diagram: Product Retrieval}
\label{fig:api-flow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{API Security and Rate Limiting}

API security will be implemented using JWT for authentication and authorization.  Each request will be validated to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.  Rate limiting will be implemented using a sliding window algorithm to prevent denial-of-service attacks and ensure fair resource allocation.  Input validation will be performed on all requests to prevent injection attacks.

\section{Security Architecture and Implementation}

\subsection{Security Requirements and Threat Model}

The platform's security architecture will be built on a layered approach, incorporating various security controls at different levels.  A threat model will be developed to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks.  Key security requirements include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure authentication and authorization using JWT.
    \item Data encryption both in transit and at rest.
    \item Regular security audits and penetration testing.
    \item Implementation of a robust Web Application Firewall (WAF).
    \item Protection against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:security}
\end{figure}

\section{Deployment and Infrastructure}

\subsection{Cloud Infrastructure Design}

The platform will be deployed on AWS using a combination of EC2 instances for application servers, RDS for the database, and S3 for static assets.  A load balancer will distribute traffic across multiple application servers, ensuring high availability and scalability.  Auto-scaling will be implemented to automatically adjust the number of application servers based on demand.  A disaster recovery plan will be in place to ensure business continuity in case of an outage.  The infrastructure will be designed for high availability and fault tolerance.
